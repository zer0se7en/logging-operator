# Logging operator logging chart

This chart has been relocated under e2e/charts where it is used to run the e2e tests with.

All modifications should go there first, get tested and then synchronized to https://github.com/kube-logging/helm-charts/ where it is linted and released.

This is an unfortunate temporary workflow, but the plan is to move the charts back here and release from this repo to an OCI registry in the near future.
